XMML is short for eXtended MML.  It allows you to do things that you cannot do using traditional MML.

XMML allows you to:
- define and use instrument patches
- use portamento to slide from note to note
- store data in variables
- transpose to any key
- target notes directly without having to worry about jumping up and down octaves
- generate random sounds
